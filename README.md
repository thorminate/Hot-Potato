# Hot Potato
This mod adds a simple hot potato gamemode for you to play around with. 

### Installation
Make sure fabric is installed on your minecraft instance and simply add the .jar file to your mods folder.

### Usage
Once installed, hop on the game and write the command "/start-hot-potato" in chat to begin the game. It will pick someone at random and they become the "hot potato." Per default, it will set a timer of 30 seconds, to amend this just write the wished time as arguments on the "/start-hot-potato" command. The arguments are as follows: "/start-hot-potato \<minutes> \<seconds> \<player>". The player argument can be used if you want to force a specific player to become the hot potato.

If you want to stop the game before it ends, run the "/stop-hot-potato" command.

Once the hot-potato right-clicks another player, the hot potato gets transfered.
